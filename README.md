## ðŸš€ Quick start to use source code

You could navigate to the website, but if you don't want to:

1.  clone the repo

2.  **Install dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the App!**

    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```
    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

4.  **Start Analyzing!**

    [It comes from here](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler-Analyst)

    Unzip the file, and press the upload button in the app and upload the folder. Once uploading and initial training is complete, you can now:
    * Fetch images (Random, Positive, Negative, By Image, Training Set Positive/Negative, Confusing)
    * Train on images dragged from Unclassified into Positive and Negative grids
    * Evaluate (look at the confusion matrix on the training set)
    * Score All (calculate the enrichment scores with Empirical Bayes and look at/download the data)
    * Download the model spec and its corresponding weights files
